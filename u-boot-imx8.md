## Introduction

Below are details how to build ATF (ARM Trusted Firmware), U-Boot (boot loader) and Linux kernel for i.MX8M HummingBoard Pulse and CuBox-Pulse

## Building U-Boot from Sources

### Toolchain

You can either build or download a ready-to-use toolchain. An example of such toolchains are from Linaro website.

When writing this document the following toolchain was used – http://releases.linaro.org/components/toolchain/binaries/7.3-2018.05/aarch64-linux-gnu/gcc-linaro-7.3.1-2018.05-i686_aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.xz

Linaro updates it’s toolchain quite often and more frequent one can be downloaded from here – http://releases.linaro.org/components/toolchain/binaries/

Download and extract the toolchain into some place; and as instructed below the CROSS_COMPILE environment variables needs to be set to the path of the toolchain prefex.

For instance if the toolchain was extracted under /opt/imx8m/toolchain/gcc-linaro-7.3.1-2018.05-i686_aarch64-linux-gnu/ then the CROSS_COMPILE needs to be set as follows –

    export ARCH=arm64
    export CROSS_COMPILE=/opt/imx8m/toolchain/gcc-linaro-7.3.1-2018.05-i686_aarch64-linux-gnu/bin/aarch64-linux-gnu-

### Download Source and Firmware

    git clone https://source.codeaurora.org/external/imx/imx-atf.git -b imx_4.19.35_1.0.0 arm-trusted-firmware
    git clone https://github.com/SolidRun/u-boot.git -b v2018.11-solidrun
    wget https://www.nxp.com/lgfiles/NMG/MAD/YOCTO/firmware-imx-7.9.bin

### ATF

Building ATF is as follows – *make sure you have set your ARCH and CROSS_COMPILE environment variables as noted above*

    cd arm-trusted-firmware
    make PLAT=imx8mq bl31
    cp build/imx8mq/release/bl31.bin ../u-boot/
    cd ..

### Extract and copy firmware

Extract the NXP firmware archive and accept the end user agreement

    chmod +x firmware-imx-7.9.bin
    ./firmware-imx-7.9.bin
    cp firmware-imx-7.9/firmware/hdmi/cadence/signed_hdmi_imx8m.bin u-boot/
    cp firmware-imx-7.9/firmware-imx-7.9/firmware/ddr/synopsys/lpddr4*.bin u-boot/

### U-Boot

Build U-Boot and generate the image - *make sure you have set your ARCH and CROSS_COMPILE environment variables as noted above*

## Deploying U-Boot

### to microSD

    sudo dd if=flash.bin of=/dev/sd[x] bs=1024 seek=33

## Configure Boot Sequence (DIPs S1+SW3)

On HummingBoard Pulse the Boot Sequence can be configured through the DIP switches S1 and SW3. In this section, **1** refers to the "*ON*" position as printed on the switch. Order is from left to right, e.g. 10 means switch 1 set to 1, and switch 2 set to 0.

### Boot Mode

The i.MX8M SoCs support the following 3 boot modes configurable through the S1 DIP switches on HummingBoard Pulse

- **00**: Use eFuse settings, fall-back to Serial Download on error.
- **01**: Serial Download
- **10**: Use eFuse settings, but override with GPIOs (DIP SW3); Can be disabled by blowing BT_FUSE_SEL.

### Boot Source

When boot mode is **10**, the DIP switches SW3 can be used for selecting the actual boot device:

- **1100**: microSD (mmc2)
- **0010**: eMMC (mmc1)
- **0001**: SPI Flash

## Linux Kernel

Kernel sources are found on SolidRun’s github site – https://github.com/SolidRun/linux-fslc.git

To build from source; follow the following steps –

    git clone https://github.com/SolidRun/linux-fslc.git -b solidrun-imx_4.9.x_imx8m_ga
    cd linux-fslc
    export CROSS_COMPILE=<point to you ARM64 cross compiler as indicated above>
    export ARCH=arm64
    make Image dtbs

The result files are –

    Image - kernel image in FIT format
    arch/arm64/boot/dts/freescale/fsl-imx8mq-hummingboard-pulse.dtb - HummingBoard pulse device tree
